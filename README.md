- 随着城市轨道交通能耗日益剧增，如何提高再生制动能量利用以降低列车运行能耗成为关键。本文聚焦多列车协同运行过程的追踪列车运行控制策略优化问题。首先，在传统运行工况演变策略的基础上，针对追踪运行场景提出“牵引-惰行-牵引-巡航-惰行-制动”策略。其次，构建空间域列车动力学模型、状态转移方程以及能耗模型，并应用插值法将时域的运行协同问题转变为空间域的工况转换点求解问题。随后，构建以运行能耗与准时性为目标的优化决策模型，并结合蜣螂优化算法进行高效求解。最后，以北京地铁亦庄线为仿真线路，对比分析了基于通信的列车控制(CBTC)与列车自主控制(TACS)架构以及不同演变策略对优化效果的影响。结果表明：相较于CBTC，TACS显著提升协同运行优化效果；所提出策略满足准时性需求的同时，在不同发车间隔下的能耗表现均优于传统策略。因此，所提出的工况演变策略与优化求解方法对城轨列车运控技术发展具有一定借鉴意义。

- With the escalating energy consumption in urban rail transit system, enhancing the utilization of regenerative braking energy to reduce train operational energy consumption has become a critical issue. This paper focuses on the optimization of tracking train control strategy in cooperative operation, in the context of train-following scenario. Firstly, building upon traditional operational mode transition strategy, a novel "Traction-Coasting-Traction-Cruising-Coasting-Braking" strategy is proposed specifically for train-following scenario. Secondly, a spatial-domain train dynamics model, state transition equation, and energy consumption model are established. By employing interpolation method, the time-domain cooperative operation problem is transformed into a spatial-domain optimization problem of determining optimal transition points. Subsequently, a multi-objective optimization decision model is constructed, considering both energy consumption and punctuality, which is then efficiently solved using the Dung Beetle Optimizer. Finally, using the Beijing Yizhuang Metro Line as a case study, a comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the optimization effects of Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) and Train Autonomous Control System (TACS) architectures, as well as different transition strategies. The results demonstrate that TACS significantly enhances cooperative operation optimization compared to CBTC. The proposed strategy not only meets punctuality requirements but also outperforms traditional strategies in energy efficiency across various headway intervals. Specifically, the net absorbed energy can be increased by up to 14.651 kWh, while the actual operational energy consumption can be reduced by up to 11.284 kWh. Therefore, the proposed operational mode transition strategy and optimization method effectively offer valuable insights for the advancement of urban rail train control technologies.
